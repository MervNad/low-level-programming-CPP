# Low-Level Programming in C++

Welcome to my repository, Low-Level Programming in C++! This repository is a comprehensive collection of everything I am learning about C++ programming. My name is Merveilles Biende Katumba, and I am the owner of this repository.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

### Chapters

Each chapter covers various topics from basic to advanced concepts in C++. These folders will include:

- Chapter Notes: Summaries and important concepts from the chapter.
- Exercises: Solutions to the exercises provided in each chapter.

### Projects

This section is divided into two main sub-sections:

#### College Projects

This folder contains all the projects I built during my Introduction to Programming course in my first year at college. The projects are divided into two semesters, each with its own folder:

- CS121 (Fall Semester): Contains four projects developed during the fall semester.
- CS132 (Spring Semester): Contains four projects developed during the spring semester.

#### Personal Projects

This folder contains various personal projects that I have built to apply and extend my knowledge of C++. Each project will have its own sub-folder with the following:

- Source Code: The .cpp files for the project.
- README: A brief description of the project, its purpose, and how to run it.
- Resources: Any additional resources or references used in the project.

## Primary Learning Source

The primary sources of learning for this repository are:

- The official [C++ website](https://isocpp.org/).
