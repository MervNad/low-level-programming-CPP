# Looping

## iteration or repetiton

it is the third basic building block of programming, sequence, selection and iteration.
allows the execution of a statement  or block of statements repeatedly.
Loops are made up of a loop condition and the body which contains the statement to repeat.

## Use cases

Execute a loop:
1. a specific number of times
2. for each element in a collection
3. while a specific condition remains true
4. until a specific condition becomes false
5. until we reach the end of some input stream
6. forever (Operating system loops forever executing system calls and processes)
7. etc...

##  C++ Looping Constructs
1. for loop
iterate a specific number of times.
2. Range-based for loop
one iteration for each element in a range or collection.
3. while loop
iterate while a condition remains true.
stop when the condition becomes false.
check the condition at the beginning of every iteration.
4. do-while loop
iterate while a condition remains true.
stop when the condition becomes false.
check the condition at the end of every iteration.
